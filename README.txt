This project is for purely educational use

The vocabulary can only be reclustered with access to the dataset

Simply delete cluster_vocab.npy and the program will recluster it

But this also requires rewriting the samples

So samples.npy will have to be deleted as well, or whenever the ANN needs to be retrained

So basically don't delete those, unless you have access to the dataset.

If you would like to access the dataset please email me or message me on GitHub, or if you have any questions about this project

The tester program will output to the folder in the output path macro inside, but only if the folder already exists
